### Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap

### Testing

This portfolio is meant to showcase my skills that i learned in a short period of time. it's to showcase other people in the future what i am capable of doing and i wanna improve this portfolio when i got a little bit more experience.


### Features

I've went for a collapsed navbar regardless of the screen, cause i have the feeling it would've fit the best for my site.

### Features left to implent
