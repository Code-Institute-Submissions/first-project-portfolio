# Joeri van den Kieboom Portfolio

First Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my very first project in programming, i tried to do different kind of things so i could train myself and let other people see that i might be capable of doing more

### Website

Website-link could be found [here](https://joeri157.github.io/first-project-portfolio/index.html)

### Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap

### Testing

This portfolio is meant to showcase my skills that i learned in a short period of time. it's to showcase other people in the future what i am capable of doing and i wanna improve this portfolio when i got a little bit more experience.
So when you open my portfolio on a desktop you will see that every section has a picture. when you go towards lower pixels you will see that some of the picture will dissapear so it wont be as busy as it should be on smaller devices.
Also every font-awesome icon has a a clickable link (same goes for the pictures), because some icons will go away on smaller devices, so you are still able to visit the sites.

On the contact section you will get a notification when you didnt fill in the required content. After when you've entered all the required content and you click on send a new window will open to send it towards me, because i've added a mailto in the form towards me.

All links will open on a new tab because of the 'target="_blank"' and this also means for the CV. I went for the new tab CV, cause i didnt want people to download an unnecessary file when you accidently click on it. You are able to download it with inside the new tab.
Ever link is tested to get you to the right destination.

The Navbar also moves you to the correct sections when you click on them.

### Features

I've went for a collapsed navbar regardless of the screen, cause i have the feeling it would've fit the best for my site.

### Features left to implent

for now there are projects of other people on it, because i dont made alot of projects yet. i implent to update this portfolio in the future with other projects.
